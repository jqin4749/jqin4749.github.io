I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I am advised by [Prof. Raymond Yeung](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/yeung-wai-ho-raymond/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with First Class Honor from The University of Sydney in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Philip Leong](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/philip-leong.html). My research interests are in the area of aritifical intelligence, information theory, and communication system.
